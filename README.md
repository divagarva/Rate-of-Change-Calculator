# Rate-of-Change-Calculator
 This Python project, "Rate of Change Calculator," computes the rate of change (slope) between two points on a coordinate plane. The program accepts user input for point coordinates, performs error handling for invalid entries, and provides the rate of change with clear output, making it ideal for learning basic mathematical concepts.
